YouTube URI Lookup Irssi Script - It's better than your mama!

Parses Youtube URIs and uses Youtube's Data API (http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html) to output the link info to the channel window.

Also works in query windows, though you might get unexpected results if you are not using the "(msgs)" window for queries. Comments/improvments regarding this are more than welcome!

Put the script in your Irssi scripts folder, run it and it just works. Tested in Perl 5.10.

License blah blah: Do whatever you want with it, give credit to me if you think I deserve it. :)
