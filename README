YouTube URI Lookup Irssi Script - It's better than your mama!

Parses Youtube URIs and uses Youtube's Data API v3 (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) to output the link info to the channel window.

Also works in query windows, though you might get unexpected results if you are not using the "(msgs)" window for queries. Comments/improvments regarding this are more than welcome!

Put the script in your Irssi scripts folder, run it and then set the API key;

`/set youtube_api_key YOUTUBE_API_KEY`

To get a key, create an application in the Google Developer Console and generate a public API access key.

Tested in Perl 5.10.

License blah blah: Do whatever you want with it, give credit to me if you think I deserve it. :)
